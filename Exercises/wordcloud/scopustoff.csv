"Clusters that are not there: An R tutorial and a Shiny app to quantify a priori inferential risks when using clustering methods","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204446985&doi=10.1002%2fijop.13246&partnerID=40&md5=a63fb34e220f2a96415f55fdf8781312","Clustering methods are increasingly used in social science research. Generally, researchers use them to infer the existence of qualitatively different types of individuals within a larger population, thus unveiling previously “hidden” heterogeneity. Depending on the clustering technique, however, valid inference requires some conditions and assumptions. Common risks include not only failing to detect existing clusters due to a lack of power but also revealing clusters that do not exist in the population. Simple data simulations suggest that under conditions of sample size, number, correlation and skewness of indicators that are frequently encountered in applied psychological research, commonly used clustering methods are at a high risk of detecting clusters that are not there. Generally, this is due to some violations of assumptions that are not usually considered critical in psychology. The present article illustrates a simple R tutorial and a Shiny app (for those who are not familiar with R) that allow researchers to quantify a priori inferential risks when performing clustering methods on their own data. Doing so is suggested as a much-needed preliminary sanity check, because conditions that inflate the number of detected clusters are very common in applied psychological research scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Understanding sex/gender differences in intelligence profiles of children with Autism: A comprehensive WISC meta-analysis","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205666134&doi=10.1016%2fj.ridd.2024.104854&partnerID=40&md5=97e91468c50165a0c2a544ce8c5def19","Background: Intelligence assessment in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often sparks debates about sex/gender differences. Specifically, the question arises whether girls exhibit lower performance on intelligence scales compared to boys. This meta-analysis examines nine studies (N=1105; 809 boys and 296 girls) to quantify sex/gender differences on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) in children with ASD, comparing their results to typically developing children. Method and procedures: Random-effects meta-analyses on WISC indices and subtests were conducted to address the heterogeneity across effect sizes. Results for children with ASD were compared to those of typically developing children. Outcomes and results: Findings revealed no significant differences in general intellectual functioning (full-scale IQ), verbal comprehension, working memory, or processing speed between boys and girls in children with ASD. Boys showed an advantage only in the perceptual reasoning index. At the subtest level, boys outperformed on certain tasks, while girls excelled in others. Conclusions and implications: The observed pattern of differences in the ASD population aligns quantitatively with those in typically developing populations. Differences, if present, are specific to certain indices rather than general intelligence. These insights contribute to a nuanced understanding of gender-related cognitive variations in the context of ASD. © 2024 The Authors","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Intelligence; Sex/gender differences; WISC"
"Maths anxiety and subjective perception of control, value and success expectancy in mathematics","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178160998&doi=10.1098%2frsos.231000&partnerID=40&md5=cef3a9e4b7cd65f8fb44c44b08780790","Mathematics anxiety (MA) is an academic anxiety related to doing, learning and testing mathematics. MA can negatively affect mathematics performance, motivation and maths-heavy science and technology-related career choices. Previous data suggest that subjective perceptions and interpretations of students are key in the genesis of MA. Here, based on expectancy-value and control-value theory, we aimed to identify potential, theoretically based subjective factors probably key to understanding MA. We analysed data from 151 745 fifteen-year-old children from 65 'countries and economies' from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 dataset. Subjective self-perceptions had a stronger relationship with MA than maths achievement. We found that higher MA was associated with lower perceived control over maths activities and lower subjective expectation of success. Surprisingly, children with higher subjective valuation of maths had higher MA for similar levels of subjective control and success expectancy in maths. Results offer an improved understanding of potential antecedents of MA and suggest that effective interventions could be based on gradual confidence building in maths. These could primarily draw on a deeper understanding of the subject improving subjective success expectancy and feeling of control over maths activities. Cultural variation in findings is discussed. © 2023 The Authors.","control-value theory; expectancy-value theory; maths anxiety (ma); motivation; subjective factors; value of mathematics"
"In emotion and reading motivation, children with a diagnosis of dyslexia are not just the end of a continuum","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198642371&doi=10.1002%2fdys.1778&partnerID=40&md5=671a1f426fbe55b1a599f2d70bfb6aaf","Children with dyslexia (CwD) often report poor psychological well-being. We examined (i) whether anxiety, self-concept and reading motivation in CwD differed from those of typically developing children (TDC; case–control design, Study 1a) and (ii) whether these differences mirrored the linear relationships that these variables present with reading ability in the TDC group (dimensional approach, Study 1b). In Study 1a, 34 CwD were compared with 191 TDC in grades 4–8 on anxiety, self-concept, reading motivation and reading strategy using self-reports (controlling for sex, intelligence and math ability scores). In Study 1b, the differences that emerged in Study 1a were compared with the results obtained from a simulation procedure that generated dyslexia observations under the assumptions of a dimensional hypothesis. The CwD group presented small-to-moderate difficulties, which partially mirrored the predictions in the TDC group. However, violations of predictions based on the population without dyslexia were found for reading self-concept, social anxiety and reading competitiveness. In sum, children's diagnoses affect their self-perception as readers and social anxiety in a way that cannot be inferred from linear relationships. CwD need support to preserve an adequate image of themselves as readers and cope with social anxiety. © 2024 The Author(s).

"The Intellectual Profile of Adults with Specific Learning Disabilities","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180649975&doi=10.3390%2fjintelligence11120223&partnerID=40&md5=24c98f6b9c55914c8a09d39ab41d9e31","Despite growing research on adults with specific learning disabilities (SLDs), evidence concerning their intellectual profile remains scarce. The present study examined the results of the administration of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Fourth Edition to 301 adults diagnosed with SLDs and compared them to the results obtained from previous studies with a large sample of children with SLDs. The results showed that: (1) as observed among children, adults with SLDs also presented higher scores in the subtests implying reasoning (associated with the General Ability Index, GAI) and lower scores in the subtests involving working memory and processing speed; (2) the discrepancy between full-scale IQ and the GAI had a good predictive value in discriminating adults with and without SLDs; (3) the four-factor hierarchical structure of intelligence proposed for the general adult population held for adults with SLDs as well, even though there were substantial differences in the loadings and a five-factor structure could be more appropriate; (4) similarities as well as strong differences were present between adults and children with SLDs. In adults, scores on subtests were generally lower, particularly in working memory and processing speed. However, in some cases, scores were equal or even higher (as in the “Similarity” subtest) among adults, meaning that the discrepancy between the full scale and the GAI was accentuated. © 2023 by the authors.","adults with SLD; intelligence; processing speed; working memory"
"Sex/gender differences in general cognitive abilities: an investigation using the Leiter-3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193065031&doi=10.1007%2fs10339-024-01199-9&partnerID=40&md5=22400ca221f2717369b5a3f35fe2a393","Research has shown that differences between males and females are not in general intelligence, but only in some specific factors and tasks. We used the Italian standardization of the Leiter-3, which is a completely nonverbal cognitive battery, to investigate the nature of sex/gender (we used sex/gender to reflect the awareness that the effects of biological ‘sex’ and socially constructed ‘gender’ cannot be easily separated and that most individuals’ identities are informed by both sex and gender) differences. In doing so we used a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis approach. Results confirmed that males and females perform similarly in general intelligence, but present with some specificities. Males perform better on some, but not all, tasks requiring the spatial manipulation of the stimuli, but females consistently outperform males in tasks such as the nonverbal Stroop, requiring inhibition and attention control to a larger extent. The clinical and practical implications of our findings are considerable. The identification of specific cognitive strengths and weaknesses in males and females underscores the importance of tailored approaches in clinical assessments and interventions. © The Author(s) 2024.","Intelligence; Leiter; MGFCA; Sex/gender"

Mean sex differences and variance ratios (VRs) were obtained from 75 studies that included 124 independent samples, 571 effect sizes. The outcomes included full scale IQ, individual subtests, and composite indices based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll ability model (e.g., visual processing, gV, and crystallized intelligence, gC). Although males were more variable in several domains (e.g., gV, gC), females were more variable for processing speed (gS), and there were no VR differences for still other domains (e.g., short-term verbal memory). The cross-domain differences in VRs were linearly related to the magnitude of mean sex differences, suggesting that the sex with the advantage at the mean is often the more variable sex. A theoretical model that accounts for this pattern is proposed. © 2024","Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC); Children; Meta-analysis; Sex differences; Variance ratio; Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC)"
"Oral language interventions can improve language outcomes in children with neurodevelopmental disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177885625&doi=10.1002%2fcl2.1368&partnerID=40&md5=cd70af616d4762e23ad05e0d7649f639","Background: Young people who fail to develop language as expected face significant challenges in all aspects of life. Unfortunately, language disorders are common, either as a distinct condition (e.g., Developmental Language Disorder) or as a part of another neurodevelopmental condition (e.g., autism). Finding ways to attenuate language problems through intervention has the potential to yield great benefits not only for the individual but also for society as a whole. Objectives: This meta-analytic review examined the effect of oral language interventions for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Search Methods: The last electronic search was conducted in April 2022. Selection Criteria: Intervention studies had to target language skills for children from 2 to 18 years of age with Developmental Language Disorder, autism, intellectual disability, Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and Williams syndrome in randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental designs. Control groups had to include business-as-usual, waiting list, passive or active conditions. However, we excluded studies in which the active control group received a different type, delivery, or dosage of another language intervention. Eligible interventions implemented explicit and structured activities (i.e., explicit instruction of vocabulary, narrative structure or grammatical rules) and/or implicit and broad activities (i.e., shared book reading, general language stimulation). The intervention studies had to assess language skills in receptive and/or expressive modalities. Data Collection and Analysis: The search provided 8195 records after deduplication. Records were screened by title and abstract, leading to full-text examinations of 448 records. We performed Correlated and Hierarchical Effects models and ran a retrospective power analysis via simulation. Publication bias was assessed via p-curve and precision-effect estimate. Main Results: We examined 38 studies, with 46 group comparisons and 108 effects comparing pre-/post-tests and eight studies, with 12 group comparisons and 21 effects at follow-up. The results showed a mean effect size of d = 0.27 at the post-test and d = 0.18 at follow-up. However, there was evidence of publication bias and overestimation of the mean effects. Effects from the meta-analysis were significantly related to these elements: (1) receptive vocabulary and omnibus receptive measures showed smaller effect sizes relative to expressive vocabulary, grammar, expressive and receptive discourse, and omnibus expressive tests; and (2) the length of the intervention, where longer sessions conducted over a longer period of time were more beneficial than brief sessions and short-term interventions. Neither moderators concerning participants’ characteristics (children's diagnosis, diagnostic status, age, sex, and non-verbal cognitive ability and severity of language impairment), nor those regarding of the treatment components and implementation of the language interventions (intervention content, setting, delivery agent, session structure of the intervention or total number of sessions) reached significance. The same occurred to indicators of study quality. The risk of bias assessment showed that reporting quality for the studies examined in the review was poor. Authors’ Conclusions: In sum, the current evidence base is promising but inconclusive. Pre-registration and replication of more robust and adequately powered trials, which include a wider range of diagnostic conditions, together with more long-term follow-up comparisons, are needed to drive evidence-based practice and policy. © 2023 The Authors.

"Math anxiety and math achievement in primary school children: Longitudinal relationship and predictors","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188013954&doi=10.1016%2fj.learninstruc.2024.101906&partnerID=40&md5=0f7c8e91ba15866ffcd831f339e3e145","Background: Math anxiety (MA) and math achievement (MATH) are related, but the direction of their relationship and their predictors are still unclear. Aims: We tested whether MATH predicts MA (Deficit Theory), MA predicts MATH (Debilitating Anxiety Theory), or whether MA and MATH have reciprocal relationships (Reciprocal Theory). Further, we established whether MA at T0, T1, and T2 and MATH at T1 and T2 were predicted by gender, general anxiety, fluid intelligence, verbal and visuospatial working memory, and symbolic and non-symbolic numerical representations tested at T0. Sample: We tested 337 Polish primary school children. Methods: We analyzed longitudinal data at three time points: T0 – the beginning of the first grade, T1 – the end of the first grade, T2 – the end of the second grade. Results: MATH at T1 predicted MA at T2 and MA at T1 predicted MATH at T2 (supporting the Reciprocal Theory). Additionally, MATH at T1 was predicted by fluid intelligence, visuospatial working memory, and symbolic numerical representation; MATH at T2 by fluid intelligence, verbal working memory, and MATH at T1. MA at T0 was predicted by general anxiety and symbolic numerical representation, MA at T1 by MA at T0 and gender, and MA at T2 by MA at T1. Conclusions: The results support the Reciprocal Theory of the MA and MATH relationship. MA is predicted by general anxiety, knowledge of mathematical symbols and gender. MATH is predicted by fluid intelligence, working memory and knowledge of mathematical symbols. © 2024","Longitudinal study; Math achievement; Math anxiety; Primary school"
"Learning disorders and difficulties: From a categorical to a dimensional perspective","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196185668&doi=10.1016%2fj.lindif.2024.102490&partnerID=40&md5=680c1ac7417070fbdcf0f03c0ce526c2","According to the emerging dimensional framework, most neurodevelopmental disorders may be conceptualised as extreme ends of developmental continua that span through the entire population (e.g., Astle et al., 2022; Peters & Ansari, 2019). This framework describes not only learning difficulties, but potentially most neurodiversity as the result of individuals being distributed along a manifold of variously correlated and continuous dimensions, that span from neurotypicality to neurodivergence in a largely seamless way. In this, a heterogeneous range of conditions may easily be reframed as part of the general variability in the population, rather than as segmented subpopulations with qualitatively different features. In the present editorial, we discuss this framework with reference to the field of learning disorders and difficulties. We will repeatedly refer to the suggestions made by Astle et al. (2022) in their review on the “transdiagnostic revolution” of neurodevelopmental disorders. The research program that they advocate has two methodological tenets: investigating underlying continuous dimensions (dimensional framework), and exploring clustering (with an eye to potentially developing new data-driven taxonomies). Here, we mainly endorse adopting a dimensional framework, at least in the field of learning disorders, while we raise some cautionary notes on the risks of clustering. We also discuss open issues related to recruiting participants, improving psychometrics tools, and discovering cognitive and non-cognitive correlates of conditions when it comes to studying learning difficulties and learning disorders. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",""
